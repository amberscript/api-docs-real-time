# Introduction

Welcome to AmberScript's Realt Time Transcription API!

This page will guide you through setting up a websocket connection to our Real Time Transcription endpoint.

<aside class="notice">
    Our API only supports the Websocket protocol as defined in the rfc <a href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455'>here.</a>
</aside>

## Authentication and initialisation

> Example A: INIT message

```json
{
  "messageType": "INIT",
  "language": "en",
  "apiKey": "<your-api-key>",
  "audioConfig": {
    "sample_rate": 16000,
    "encoding": "s16le"
  },
  "outputConfig": {
    "format": "transcription",
    "partials": false
  }
}
```

We will provide you with an `API_KEY` required to access our endpoints.

Authentication is done via an "INIT" type message which must be sent as the first message once the socket connection is established. Anything else will result in errors and the incoming connection will be terminated.

In addition to the API key, you must also pass the [language](#language-codes), audio, and format configurations. If you omit the latter two, defaults will be chosen for you, which may result in a poor transcription quality.

The audio configuration must contain the sample rate of your audio input together with the [encoding](#supported-encodings)

And example of the INIT message, using the default values looks like this:


As of version 1.0, we only support the transcription format.

##Â Using the transcription API
> Example B: Sending and receiving messages

```javascript
const SERVER_IP = "api.amberscript.com/real-time/";
// example only for node clients.
const WebSocket = require("ws");
const client = new WebSocket("wss://api.amberscript.com/real-time/");
client.on("open", () => {
  client.alive = true;
  client.send(
    JSON.stringify({
      messageType: "INIT",
      language: 'en',
      apiKey: 'my-api-key',
      audioConfig: {
        sample_rate: 48000,
        encoding: "s32le",
      },
      outputConfig: {
        partials: true,
      },
    })
  );
  interval();
});

client.on("message", (message) => onMessage(message));
client.on("pong", () => {
  client.alive = true;
});

function sendAudio(audioBuffer) {
  if (client.readyState) {
    cleint.send(audioBuffer);
  }
}
// set up ping pong from your client to the service
let interval = () =>
  setInterval(() => {
    if (!client.alive) {
      client.terminate();
      client = new WebSocket("wss://api.amberscript.com/real-time/");
    } else {
      if (client.readyState) {
        client.ping();
        client.alive = false;
      }
    }
  }, 30000);

function onMessage(data) {
  let objMsg = JSON.parse(data);
  switch (objMsg.type) {
    case "PartialResult":
      // object.message has the partial transcription for this segment
      break;
    case "FinalResult":
      // object.message has the final transcription for this segment
      break;
    case "Info":
      // object.message contains information regarding your configuration
      break;
    case "Warning":
      // object.message contains data regarding the warning and a reason
      break;
    case "Error":
      // object.message contains a reason for the error
      break;
  }
  return false;
}
```
> Example C: Message structure

```json
{
  "type": "<String; one of the types from the table on the left>",
  "message": "<String | Object<message: Array<Object>>>"
}
```
<aside class="warning">
    Your client will be getting regular ping messages as defined in the <a href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#page-37'>protocol specification</a>. Make sure that your client will respond with pongs, or your connection will be terminated. If you are using a browser client, your client will automatically reply to pings. If you are using a Websocket library for your back-end client, then please make sure that the library is compliant with the protocol.
</aside>

After sending the initialisation message, you can then start sending the audio packets.

If you are not using a browser client, we recommend setting up a ping/pong mechanism so your client can detect connection drops and reconnect.

Once you start sending audio data, you should expect to receive tanscriptions.

If something goes wrong during setup, or if the server loses its connection to one of our workers, you will receive warnings. This does not mean that your session is lost, but it is possible that you will have to wait until connections are reestablished. You will be informed of the current retry count, maximum retries, and the time until a connection is retried.

### Return message types


> Example D: Warning example

```json
{
    "type": "Warning",
    "current_counter": 1,
    "max_retries": 4,
    "current_timer": 10,
    "message": "Workers are not available. Retrying connection in 10 seconds..."
  
}
```

> Example E: Partial result type

```json
{
  "type": "PartialResult",
  "message": {
    "id": "682758c0-47bb-44b4-b4d3-93952580aa25",
    "version": "1.0",
    "segments": [
      {
        "words": [
          {
            "word": "Testing"
          },
          {
            "word": "testing"
          },
          {
            "word": "testing"
          },
          {
            "word": "testing"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "transcript": "Testing testing testing testing"
  }
}
```

> Example F: Final result type

```json
{
  "type": "FinalResult",
  "message": {
    "id": "682758c0-47bb-44b4-b4d3-93952580aa25",
    "version": "1.0",
    "segments": [
      {
        "words": [
          {
            "word": "Testing,",
            "start": 0,
            "end": 1.23,
            "length": 0.6,
            "confidence": 1
          },
          {
            "word": "testing,",
            "start": 2.67,
            "end": 3.21,
            "length": 0.54,
            "confidence": 1
          },
          {
            "word": "testing,",
            "start": 3.21,
            "end": 3.72,
            "length": 0.51,
            "confidence": 1
          },
          {
            "word": "testing,",
            "start": 3.72,
            "end": 4.23,
            "length": 0.51,
            "confidence": 1
          }
        ],
        "start": 0,
        "end": 8.28,
        "length": 8.28
      }
    ],
    "transcript": "Testing, testing, testing, testing, "
  }
}
```

This service will output different types of messages:


| Type   | Description                              |
|------- |----------------------------------------  |
| Error  | Standard auth, bad input errors along with connectivity issues, such as failure to connect to workers, or transcription errors. In the case of worker errors, clients will get the errors that were sent by the workers. |
| Info   | General information about audio configuration |
| Warning | Used when any disruptions of service occur (errors on the part of the workers/connection issues). You will also get warning if bad input was detected in your configuration. |
| PartialResult | Partial transcription received from the workers. Partial transcripts will not be having alignment information, nor will it have any confidence information. However, you can expect to receive partial transcriptions almost immmediately. Do be aware that these transcriptions are likely to change until a final transcription is received. You can use the unique identifier for a segment to track these changes. |
| FinalResult | Final transcription for that segment of speech. Will not be recieving any more updates for this segment. Will contain alignment and confidence information  |

Clients should expect the format of the messages to follow the pattern visible in Example C.


If you set the partials configured to `true`, then you will also receive partial transcriptions. You can see in the examples below that each message will have an id attached to it.

This can help you identify the sequence of the results. Each partial result will share the same id, until a final transcription is received. The final transcription will also share that id. Once you receive the final transcription, the id will reset and a new segment will start.

## Potential errors and Troubleshooting 

| Error message | Description                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Something went wrong when setting up a connection to our services. Please try again later, or contact support.  |  This error indicates that workers are not available right now. You should generally attempt new connections in 1-2 minutes after this error occurs. If the problem persists, please do contact us.  |
| Your client seems to have been inactive for more than one minute. If this is a mistake, try again or contact support  | This error is very unlikely to occur. Your implementation might not be following the WebSocket protocol, and is not responding to ping control frames as detailed in the warning [here](#using-the-transcription-API). |
| Something went wrong when processing your input. Please try again later, or contact support.  | This error might be because of faulty input. Please evaluate your input configuration and the raw output of your microphone. If the issue cannot be resolved, please do communicate this information if you decide to ask for techical support           |
| Your language configuration is missing. Please send your API key and language under the format {language: <langugage>, apiKey: <your-api-key>}. This connection will now be closed  | Make sure your JSON message is stringified and that the language configuration uses the correct key        |
| Your api key is missing. Please send your API key and language under the format {language: <langugage>, apiKey: <your-api-key>}. This connection will now be closed  |    Make sure your JSON message is stringified and that the API key uses the correct key     |
| This language is not supported.  | See [languages](#language-codes) for our supported languages. If you are interested in additional languages, please contact our support.        |

<aside class="info">
    We are planning on providing users with error codes, together with the messages detailed above in future versions. We expect that this will make troubleshooting easier, and will be more convenient, but it is currently absent from this version. We will update this section of the documentation as soon as the feature is available.
